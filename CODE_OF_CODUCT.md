# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the ENVM community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

* Celebrating the success of others

### Unacceptable Behavior

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at:

* **Email**: conduct@envm.dev or conduct@envm-org.dev

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Process

### Investigation

1. **Acknowledgment**: Reporter will receive acknowledgment of their report within 24-48 hours

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Behavior**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Behavior**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Behavior**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Behavior**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
